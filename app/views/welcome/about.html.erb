    <h4>What is UrbanHoe?</h4>
    <p>
      This application is designed to be a simple, straightforward planting guide for
      urban dwellers. The popularity of urban gardens is growing, and Urban Hoe wants to be
      a go-to reference site for quick information about what can be planted and when.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially, we have conceptualized this app as a one page informational app.
      Visitors to the site are immediately shown a large prompt near the top of the page
      asking "Where do you live?", with a form box asking them for their zip code. The
      response to this input will then present a dropdown list of plants, queried from
      the database, appropriate for that region of the country.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon choosing a plant from the list, the visitor will be shown a box displaying
      information about the chosen plant. Information displayed will come from another
      database table and contains all the vital information on how, when and where to
      grow said plant in an urban environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the functionality of the site could easily expand, we're focusing right now
      on answering one question very clearly: "What can I plant here in my new urban garden?"
