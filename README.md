# UrbanHoe
* The "What-to-Grow-and-When-and-How" Site for Urban Gardeners

## Description
This application is designed to be a simple, straightforward planting guide for
urban dwellers. The popularity of urban gardens is growing, and Urban Hoe wants to be
a go-to reference site for quick information about what can be planted and when.

Initially, we have conceptualized this app as a one page informational app.
Visitors to the site are immediately shown a large prompt near the top of the page
asking "Where do you live?", with a form box asking them for their zip code. The
response to this input will then present a dropdown list of plants, queried from
the database, appropriate for that region of the country.

Upon choosing a plant from the list, the visitor will be shown a box displaying
information about the chosen plant. Information displayed will come from another
database table and contains all the vital information on how, when and where to
grow said plant in an urban environment.

While the functionality of the site could easily expand, we're focusing right now
on answering one question very clearly: "What can I plant here in my new urban garden?"
